This code is related to a project completed whice involved :
  1) Collecting Tweets from Twitter using twitter4j programme
  NOTE: If required tweets could be stored in an extral database for example an SQL database
  
  2) Tweets were then analysed using Apache Spark and Scala to idenfity aspects of tweets such as tweet length and most common hastags
  
  The second piece of code is used to group tweets using K-means clustering technique based on tweet location. 
  
  Analysis was rerun on the grouped tweets to identify if statistics such as most common hashtags changed with location.
